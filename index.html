    <h1>The Wide-Mouthed frog!</h1>
    <p>
      The wide-mouth frog is particularly interested in the eating habits of
      other <br />
      creatures.<br />
      <br />
      He just can't stop asking the creatures he encounters what they like to
      eat. <br />
      But, then he meets the alligator who just LOVES to eat wide-mouthed
      frogs!<br />
      <br />
      When he meets the alligator, it then makes a tiny mouth.<br />
      <br />
      Your goal in this kata is to create complete the mouth_size method this
      method <br />
      takes one argument animal which corresponds to the animal encountered by
      the <br />
      frog. If this one is an alligator (case-insensitive) return small
      otherwise <br />
      return wide<br />
